Auricap XO is made using finest obtainable polypropylene film and new high purity continuous cast copper&nbsp;leads. This capacitor design changed a new level of performance is reached with even less coloration, micro-phonics and noise&nbsp;contribution than the famous Auricap. There are no drawbacks to the Auricap XO in comparison to the standard Auricap. Users can&nbsp;still expect all of the wonderful virtues for the standard Auricap is know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&quot; I wasn&#39;t sure how you can improve upon something that is so good already - The original Auricap. Was in for a nice surprise!&nbsp;WOW! The best I can describe the new Auricap XO compare to the other capacitors design is like listening to a regular copper&nbsp;cable and then to a very pure OFC high-end cable. Everything is improve,but most dramatic is the naturalness combined with&nbsp;extream 3D detail and air resulting in a bigger soundstage, yet so smooth and relaxed !&quot;</p>",
