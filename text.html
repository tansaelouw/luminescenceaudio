<p>&nbsp;&bull; At the high-end of audio design, art and science merge. The most revered audio&nbsp;designers are no
    longer strictly concerned with the objective world of measurements&nbsp;and specifications. Instead they explore the
    world of&nbsp;human expression and human&nbsp;sentiment as captured in the recorded musical performance. This is an
    exploration&nbsp;guided not by machines and technology, but by tacit knowledge, intuition and musical&nbsp;sensibility.
    There is a vast legacy of music captured on recordings dating back to the beginning of&nbsp;the&nbsp;last century.
    These recordings allow us to see into the times and the minds of the&nbsp;music&#39;s composers and performers with
    remarkable sensitivity and clarity. Music&nbsp;conveys the subtlely and fathomless depths of human experience and is
    one of our&nbsp;most profound and affecting art form.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
