Auricap XO is the result of rigorous consideration of every aspect in capacitor design and manufacturing process.&nbsp;Auricap XO has reconsidered a host of parameters including tension windings, baking times and cryogenic treatment amoung other&nbsp;proprietary procedures. Auricap XO is made using finest obtainable polypropylene film and new high purity continuous cast copper&nbsp;leads. This capacitor design changed a new level of performance is reached with even less coloration, micro-phonics and noise&nbsp;contribution than the famous Auricap. There are no drawbacks to the Auricap XO in comparison to the standard Auricap. Users can&nbsp;still expect all of the wonderful virtues for the standard Auricap is know.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&quot; I wasn&#39;t sure how you can improve upon something that is so good already - The original Auricap. Was in for a nice surprise!&nbsp;WOW! The best I can describe the new Auricap XO compare to the other capacitors design is like listening to a regular copper&nbsp;cable and then to a very pure OFC high-end cable. Everything is improve,but most dramatic is the naturalness combined with&nbsp;extream 3D detail and air resulting in a bigger soundstage, yet so smooth and relaxed !&quot;</p>\n",

Listening to Model One &nbsp;and Model Two MK III in a high performance system is a transformative&nbsp;exprience; under total control. speakers disappear and transport the listener into a three-dimansional realm where music takes on a&nbsp;palpable, tangible form. Details from source material are resolved against a black background, painting images in the space with&nbsp;vivid reality and&nbsp;magic mids, silky uppers.
